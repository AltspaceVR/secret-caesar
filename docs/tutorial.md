Tutorial flow and script
===========================

[Game start signal is received. Players are asked to select if they want the tutorial. If at least one player answers yes, everything here is read.]

**NARRATOR**: Welcome players! I am <NAME>, and I will be walking you through your first game of *Secret Hitler*.

[Role cards are presented to all players, with a confirmation card. The following dialog is skipped once everyone has checked the confirm card.]

**NARRATOR**: Everyone, take a moment to review your secret role, and if revealed, the roles of your teammates. Look at the card in front of you, and remember, because your role will determine your play strategy. Liberals, your objective is to keep your fellow liberals in power long enough to pass five liberal policies, or if things aren't going well, by assassinating Hitler. Fascists, including Hitler, your objective is to convince the liberals that you are one of them, and to sow distrust among the liberals. The fascists win if they can pass three fascist policies and get Hitler elected as chancellor, or less likely, if they pass six fascist policies, but you can't do that if the liberal majority doesn't trust you. Review your secret role now, and click the Ja card [pronounced "yah"] to continue.

[Everyone has confirmed their roles, game continues.]


[The randomly chosen presidental candidate is prompted to choose a chancellor.]

**NARRATOR**: It is time for all of you to elect a new government, composed of a President and a Chancellor. Collectively, they are responsible for passing a policy. A presidential candidate has been selected at random. If that's you, choose a running mate, the chancellor candidate, by clicking on the player of your choosing. However, players that held office last round are term-limited and will be ineligible for nomination. President, choose your Chancellor now.

[The presidential candidate chooses a running mate by clicking on that player, then confirming. Every player is prompted to vote.]

**NARRATOR**: The ticket is prepared. Everyone, decide if you want these two people to be responsible for selecting the next policy. If you approve of the ticket, vote Ja [pronounced "yah"]. If you do not, vote Nein [pronounced "nine"].

[Wait for the vote. If the vote fails, read the following immediately. If it does not fail, read this the first time it does.]

**NARRATOR**: The vote has failed! As a result, new candidates are chosen and the election process begins again. However, if the group fails to elect a government three rounds in a row, the top card in the policy deck is automatically enacted. This favors the fascists, so vote carefully!

[If the vote succeeds, read the following:]

**NARRATOR**: The vote has passed! Take a moment to look around and see how people voted. It might help you deduce hidden agendas.

[Wait for election results to be confirmed. Then:]

**NARRATOR**: President, Chancellor, the time has come to enact a policy. Do not speak to each other until the policy has been chosen. President, you have been dealt three policy cards, each either fascist or liberal. Choose one card to discard. The remainder will be passed to your Chancellor.

[Wait for president's selection.]

**NARRATOR**: Chancellor, you've been given the President's remaining policy cards. Choose another one to discard. The final card remaining will be enacted.

[Wait for chancellor's selection. Then wait for the reveal of the enacted policy to complete.]

[The first time a fascist policy was enacted:]

**NARRATOR**: Your government has passed a fascist policy! There are only three possible explanations. One, the president is fascist and discarded a liberal policy. Two, the chancellor is fascist and did the same. Three, they were dealt only fascist policies and had no choice. This last *will* happen, as a full policy deck contains only six liberal policies, and eleven fascist. 

[The first time a liberal policy was enacted:]

**NARRATOR**: Your government has passed a liberal policy, good job! Though consider the possible explanations. One, that your government is genuinely liberal and passed the correct policy to further their agenda. Two, that your government is at least partially fascist, and wants a liberal policy on their voting record as cover for future misdeeds.

[In both cases:]

**NARRATOR**: So consider carefully which of these options you think most likely. Discuss. Cast your accusations. When you're ready to continue, click the prompt.

[Wait for continue signal to start new round.]

**NARRATOR**: The first round is complete. The player to the President's left is now the presidental candidate for a new election, and the new government will pass another policy. And so the game continues until either the fascists or the liberals prevail. This is <NAME>, your helpful narrator. I hope you enjoy the remainder of your game of Secret Hitler!

[An executive power is unlocked:]

**NARRATOR**: Your increasingly fascist government has granted themselves an executive power!

[The first executive power also plays this:]

**NARRATOR**: These are unlocked only by passing fascist policies.

[If investigate:]

**NARRATOR**: Mister or Madame President, use your new executive powers to compel another player to reveal their party affiliation. This will unequivocally determine if they are liberal or fascist. Only you will see this revelation, and no single player can be investigated more than once. Feel free to share your knowledge or not, but remember, your accusations or vouches are only as credible as you are.

[If peek:]

**NARRATOR**: Mister or Madame President, use your new executive powers to examine the policy docket. The cards you see in front of you are the top three cards in the policy deck. These are the cards that the next president will draw, so use them as leverage against that government. Keep them honest, or accuse them of lying, as you see fit.

[If name successor:]

**NARRATOR**: Mister or Madame President, use your new executive powers to choose your successor. This player will be the next presidental candidate instead of the player to your left. After the next round, the chain of succession returns back to normal.

[If execute:]

**NARRATOR**: Mister or Madame President, use your new executive powers to execute your political rivals. The player you choose will be killed, and thus ineligible to vote, hold office, or join in discussion. If you kill a liberal, the narrow liberal majority will be broken, and the fascists can vote in a block to push through whatever they want. If you kill a fascist, their minority grows smaller, and the liberals have an edge. If you kill Hitler, the liberals win outright. You will not know which of the above you chose until the end of the game, so choose carefully!

[If veto:]

**NARRATOR**: Mister or Madame President, use your new executive powers to execute another political rival. In addition, you have unlocked veto powers. Future chancellors can initiate a veto if they don't want to pass either policy they're given, and if the president agrees, the entire hand is discarded. This is considered an inactive government though, and counts against your three-failed-elections counter.

[Later, during the first vote after the third fascist policy is passed:]

**NARRATOR**: Careful! Now that three fascist policies have been passed, if Hitler is elected as chancellor, the fascists win! Conversely, if someone is elected chancellor and the fascists *don't* win, that person is certainly *not* Hitler.
