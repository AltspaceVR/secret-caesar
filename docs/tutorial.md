Night phase flow and script
===========================

[Game start signal is received. Players are asked to select if they want the tutorial. If at least one player answers yes, everything here is read. If not, only the night phase dialog is read.]

**NARRATOR**: The game is afoot! I'm your narrator, I will be walking you through your first round of *Secret Hitler*.

[Role cards are presented to all players, with a confirmation card. The following dialog is skipped once everyone has checked the confirm card.]

**NARRATOR**: Everyone, take a moment to review your secret role. Look at the card in front of you, and remember, because your role will determine your play strategy. Liberals, your objective is to keep your fellow liberals in power long enough to pass five liberal policies, or if things aren't going well, by assassinating Hitler. Fascists, including Hitler, your objective is to convince the liberals that you are one of them, and to sow distrust among the liberals. The fascists win if they can pass three fascist policies and get Hitler elected as chancellor, or if they pass six fascist policies, but you can't do that if the liberal majority doesn't trust you.

**NARRATOR**: Review your secret role, and click the Ja card [pronounced "yah"] to continue.

[Everyone has confirmed their roles, night phase continues.]


[A blinking presidential hat is assigned to the new presidential candidate, that player is prompted to choose a chancellor.]

**NARRATOR**: It's time for you to elect a new government, composed of a President and a Chancellor. Collectively, they are responsible for passing a policy. A presidential candidate has been selected at random, and that player will choose a running mate, the chancellor candidate. Next round, the presidential candidacy passes to the left, and the chancellor is chosen by that candidate.

**NARRATOR**: President, choose your Chancellor now by clicking in his or her direction.

[The presidential candidate chooses a running mate by clicking on that player. A blinking chancellor hat is assigned to the chancellor. Every player is prompted to vote.]

**NARRATOR**: The ticket is prepared. Everyone, decide if you want these two people to be responsible for selecting the next policy. If you approve of the ticket, vote Ja [pronounced "yah"]. If you do not, vote Nein [pronounced "nine"].

[Wait for the vote. If the vote fails, read the following immediately. If it does not fail, read this the first time it does.]

**NARRATOR**: The vote has failed. As a result, the candidacy passes to the next in line directly without a policy chosen. However, if the group fails to elect a government three turns in a row, the top card in the policy stack is automatically enacted. This favors the fascists, because there are nearly twice the number of fascist policies in the deck as liberal. Vote carefully! [Loops back three lines.]

[If the vote succeeds, read the following:]

**NARRATOR**: The vote has passed.

**NARRATOR**: President, Chancellor, the time has come to enact a policy. Do not speak until the policy has been chosen. President, you have been dealt three policy cards, each either fascist or liberal. Choose one card to discard. The remainder will be passed to your Chancellor.

[Wait for president's selection.]

**NARRATOR**: Chancellor, you've been given the President's remaining policy cards. Choose another one to discard. The final card remaining will be enacted.

[Wait for chancellor's selection. Then wait for the reveal of the enacted policy to complete.]
