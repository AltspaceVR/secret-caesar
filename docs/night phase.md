Night phase flow and script
===========================

[Game start signal is received. Players are asked to select if they want the tutorial. If at least one player answers yes, everything here is read. If not, only the night phase dialog is read.]

**NARRATOR**: The game is afoot! I'm your narrator, I will be walking you through your first round of *Secret Hitler*.

[Role cards are presented to all players, with a confirmation card. The following dialog is skipped once everyone has checked the confirm card.]

**NARRATOR**: Everyone, take a moment to review your secret role. Look at the card in front of you, and remember, because your role will determine your play strategy. Liberals, your objective is to keep your fellow liberals in power long enough to pass five liberal policies, or if things aren't going well, by assassinating Hitler. Fascists, including Hitler, your objective is to convince the liberals that you are one of them, and to sow distrust among the liberals. The fascists win if they can pass three fascist policies and get Hitler elected as chancellor, or if they pass six fascist policies, but you can't do that if the liberal majority doesn't trust you.

**NARRATOR**: Review your secret role, and click the "ja" card to continue.

[Everyone has confirmed their roles, night phase continues.]

**NARRATOR**: Everyone, close your eyes. [All players are virtually blindfolded.]

[Role cards are placed on the table in front of Hitler and the fascists. If there are five or six players, the following is read:]

**NARRATOR**: Fascists, Hitler, open your eyes. [Blindfolds are selectively lifted from the fascists and Hitler.] Look around you, and identify the other fascists at the table.

[If there are seven to ten players, the following is read:]

**NARRATOR**: Hitler, keep your eyes closed. Fascists, open your eyes. [Blindfolds are selectively lifted from the fascists, but not Hitler.] Look around you, and identify the other fascists and Hitler at the table. Note that Hitler is unaware of your identities.

[Long pause, perhaps ten seconds. Fascists/Hitler are blindfolded again.]

**NARRATOR**: Fascists, close your eyes. Everyone, open your eyes!

[Virtual blindfolds are removed from all players. This is the end of Night Phase.]

[A blinking presidential hat is assigned to the new presidential candidate, that player is prompted to choose a chancellor.]

**NARRATOR**: It's time for you to elect a new government, composed of a President and a Chancellor. Collectively, they are responsible for passing a policy. A presidential candidate has been selected at random, and that player will choose a running mate, the chancellor candidate. Next round, the presidential candidacy passes to the left, and the chancellor is chosen by that candidate. President, choose your Chancellor now.

[The presidential candidate chooses a running mate by clicking on that player. A blinking chancellor hat is assigned to the chancellor. Every player is prompted to vote.]

**NARRATOR**: The ticket is prepared. Everyone, decide if you want these two people to be responsible for selecting the next policy. If you approve of the ticket, vote Ja [prounounced "yah"]. If you do not, vote Nein [pronounced "nine"].
